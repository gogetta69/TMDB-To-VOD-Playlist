# Getting Started

[![Video Thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gogetta69/TMDB-To-VOD-Playlist/main/images/thumb.PNG)](https://rumble.com/embed/v54v3nx/?pub=4)

1. **Configuration**: Start by setting up the script with the required free [TMDB API Key](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) and an optional private key for [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken) or [Premiumize](https://www.premiumize.me/account), which are not mandatory.

2. **Xtream Codes Integration**: Enter the IP address or domain as an Xtream Codes server. Any username and password will work since the script doesn't require authentication. This will automatically load the Live TV, Movies and TV Series playlists into the app.

3. **Non-Xtream Codes Apps**: If your app does not support Xtream Codes, load http://IP_ADDRESS/player_api.php?action=get_vod_streams (replace IP_ADDRESS with your computers ip address) in your browser, then locate the `playlist.m3u8` in the same folder as the script and load it as an M3U playlist. Note that the M3U8 playlists are available for movies and live TV only; TV series cannot be loaded as an M3U playlist.

5. **Playback**: Once everything is set up and the playlists are loaded, you should be able to play a video. Clicking the play button will trigger the script to search multiple websites in the background for a playable link. Please be patient and allow some time for a link to be found and streaming to commence. The script caches and stores the found link for approximately 3 hours, aligning with the typical access token expiration of most direct sources, which occurs at around 4 hours.

5. **Local Hosting**: If you lack a hosting company to run this extremely lightweight script, you can install and run software on your desktop computer like Xampp.

# Changes and Additions

- Added the Premiumize service as an alternative to Real-Debrid. (used only with torrent sites)
- Added threads when searching torrent sites for magnet links. (speeds up the time it takes to find a link)
- Added and fixed direct movie and TV show sources as well as more link extractors.
- Added TheTvApp sports section in the Live TV Playlist (set your app to load EPG and playlist every 12 hours or less.)
- Added PlutoTV to the live TV playlist (Multi Languages Here: https://github.com/matthuisman/i.mjh.nz)
- Redesigned the Live TV and DaddyLive functions and playlist. (all of the images in the playlist are working)
- Fixed a lot of bugs in the torrent search and filtering functions. (it finds links much more often now)
- Fixed the sorting by resolution and more likely to get higher quality links (torrent sites)
- Added adult movies to vod (disabled by default)<br>

## Updated (09/15/2024):

- Fixed & added more direct movie scrapers<br>

showBox_media requires a login and a cookie string to be added to sessions/showbox_media_cookies.txt
in order to extract links. Taking the time to add these cookies is well worth it if you aren't using
a premium link service and are seeking the best quality possible. How to: videos/how_to_showbox_media_cookie.mp4

# Creating Playlist

You no longer need to manually run create_playlist.php and create_tv_playlist.php. With the workflow set up on GitHub, these playlists are automatically generated twice a day. To create your own movies and series playlist, simply set $userCreatePlaylist to true in the config.php file.
