HeadlessVidX.exe - Windows Service Setup (setup_service.bat)

To keep the HeadlessVidX server running in the background, you must run
setup_service.bat. This sets up a Windows service so Playwright can
locate your installed Chrome browser.

During setup you will be asked for a Windows username and password.
These credentials are required only to register the service with Windows.
They are never stored, transmitted, or used for anything else.

If you are concerned, you can open setup_service.bat in any text editor
to review the code yourself.
